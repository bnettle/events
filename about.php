Since Fall 2008, the purpose of the seminar is to provide a venue for researchers and students 
to present and discuss mathematical approaches for the investigation of challenging real-life problems. 

<br>
The speakers present different mathematical models 
based on a wide variety of techniques: 
PDE, Numerical Analysis, Control Theory, just to name a few.

<br>
Topics range from pure mathematical subjects to real-life applications.

<!--Although the seminar is mainly devoted to original scientific research 
by faculty and graduate students,
we will give an opportunity for some review talks as well.
We will invite speakers from other departments 
and from different schools from around the country.-->

<br>
Another important goal of the seminar 
is to encourage students  
to develop their own research projects.  

<br>
We welcome all those who want to broaden their perspective 
on the mathematical methods used in contemporary research.

<br/>
